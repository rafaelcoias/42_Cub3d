# Cub3d

## Assigment

You must create a “realistic” 3D graphical
representation of the inside of a maze from a
first-person perspective. 
You have to create this
representation using the Ray-Casting principles
mentioned earlier.

## Goal

To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical appli-
cations of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

## Rules

  -  Window behavior must be smooth.
  -  The program should accept a map in the form of a .cub file as an argument.
  -  The map should be enclosed by walls.
  -  White spaces and newlines should be properly handled in the map.
  -  There should be four textures, each corresponding to a specific wall orientation.
  -  Two RGB colors should be provided for the floor and ceiling.
  -  It is required to use the mlx library.

## Before doing cub3D

Learn about the <a href="https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html">MiniLibx</a> library.

Understand the raycasting technique:

> Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in realtime, and raycasting was the first solution. Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen.

I hope you found it interesting!

If you are going to do minishell, I wish you good luck and hope that you learned something here!
